# Live-Training---Platformer-2D
WIP: Platformer 2D


To-Do:

- Add in HUD which displays lives, coins, usable items taken on missions?
- Map Select screen: free roaming, when in range description comes up and can be chosen to enter
- Item select screen: It's where you prep for missions you selected before entering them

NOTE: All graphics are placeholders for now.  I have not verified copyright information on them and do not intend to use them in the finished product.
